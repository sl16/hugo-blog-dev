## Goals & motivation

Envisioning a career change, I began studying at the [42 Prague](https://42prague.com) coding institute in
2023 alongside my day job. There, I acquired a strong foundation in programming, systems thinking, and
teamwork in the context of software engineering.

My growing interest in cybersecurity led me to complete two specialized courses,
which I later validated by earning two industry certifications. Now, I am seeking a
junior position where I can apply my skills and continue developing in the field.
